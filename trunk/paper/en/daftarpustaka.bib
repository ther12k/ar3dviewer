	ABSTRACT = {This paper focuses on Mixed Reality (MR) visual displays, a
	particular subset of Virtual Reality (VR) related technologies that involve
	the merging of real and virtual worlds somewhere along the ``virtuality
	continuum'' which connects completely real environments to completely
	virtual ones. Probably the best known of these is Augmented Reality (AR),
	which refers to all cases in which the display of an otherwise real
	environment is augmented by means of virtual (computer graphic) objects.
	The converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore Augmented
	Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display environments are
	identified. However, an attempt to distinguish these classes on the basis
	of whether they are primarily video or computer graphics based, whether the
	real world is viewed directly or via some electronic display medium,
	whether the viewer is intended to feel part of the world or on the outside
	looking in, and whether or not the scale of the display is intended to map
	orthoscopically onto the real world leads to quite different groupings
	among the six identified classes, thereby demonstrating the need for an
	efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to which
	essential differences can be identified. The 'obvious' distinction between
	the terms ``real'' and ``virtual'' is shown to have a number of different
	aspects, depending on whether one is dealing with real or virtual objects,
	real or virtual images, and direct or non-direct viewing of these. An
	(approximately) three dimensional taxonomy is proposed, comprising the
	following dimensions: Extent of World Knowledge (``how much do we know about
	the world being displayed?''), Reproduction Fidelity (``how 'realistically'
	are we able to display it?''), and Extent of Presence Metaphor (``what is
	the extent of the illusion that the observer is present within that
	world?'').}
